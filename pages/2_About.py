#Routing Algorithm
st.subheader("Routing Algorithm")

st.write("""
        The CSR for MSMEs was developed by analyzing various financial and socioeconomic indicators. Transactional and behavioral data were first consolidated into quarterly sums to smooth out short-term fluctuations. Categorical variables were then converted to numeric values through appropriate mapping techniques. After preprocessing the features, correlation-based feature selection was performed to enhance model efficiency, removing variables with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.8 to eliminate redundancy while preserving the most informative indicators.
         
         The framework categorized indicators into four fundamental concepts: `Financial Health`, `Credit Reliability`, `Customer Engagement`, and `Socioeconomic Stability`. Within each concept, the mean of the features was taken and then standardized using z-score transformation to ensure comparability across different measures. These standardized features were then combined through mean aggregation to create composite scores that captured the overall strength of each conceptual dimension.
         
         The final resilience score was computed by taking the average of the four concept-specific composite scores, ensuring equal weight distribution across all dimensions. To enhance interpretability, the resulting score was scaled to a range of 0 to 1 using min-max scaling. This standardized approach produced a robust metric that effectively captures multiple aspects of MSME resilience while maintaining simplicity and clarity in its interpretation.
